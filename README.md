20/04/2016 : Project should work
-
Always working, I now need to add a switch to turn it on and off.

I recommend using the smallest arduino you have, and if possible add a battery, the whole project should consume 30mA (0.15W).

Do not put the switch on the arduino to turn it on or off, put it on the power supply, this way when you turn it off, consumption goes down to 0mA (0W).
